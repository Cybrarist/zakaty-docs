# Linux / MAC / Windows Installation

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Free key from [Exchange Rate](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
- Free key from [Gold API](https://goldapi.io)

## How To Install

you can download the [docker-compose](https://github.com/Cybrarist/Zakaty/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) file.

then you can change the values inside the file as needed, if you already cloned the code you can keep 
```yaml
  build:
    context: .
```
otherwise you need ro remove the above and add the image needed.

## Volumes
you need to create the volumes in your host machine first, otherwise docker will create them as directories 
and you won't be able to keep them if you re-pulled the image.

::: warning
Please refer to [Environments](/installation/environments) to get a list of available options.
